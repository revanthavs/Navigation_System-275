Description:

This application is a route-finding server which takes the coordinates of the start and end 
points of a trip,computes the shortest path between them, and returns the route information, 
which is coordinates of the waypoints along the shortest path.

The Targets included in the Makefile are:
	make server: links digraph.o server.o and dijkstra.o, and creates the executable
	make digraph.o: compiles digraph.cpp and creates the object file
	make server.o: compiles server.cpp and creates the object file
	make dijkstra.o: compiles server.cpp and creates the object file
	make clean: removes all the object files and the executable

Running Instructions:
1) The query to the server should be of the form:
   R lat_1 lon_1 lat_2 lon_2  
   Where lat_1 and lon_1 are the latitude and longitude respectively of the starting point, 
   and lat_2 and lon_2 are the latitude and longitude respectively of the ending point. a
2) The server responds to the query by first printing the number of waypoints along the 
   path and then displaying the coordinates of each waypoint. 
3) The client must acknowledge the receipt of data by responding with character 'A' after 
   each print. The server indicates an end of session with the client by printing the letter 
   'E'.

Notes and Assumptions:
1) The server computes the Manhattan Distance between the waypoints.
2) The server responds with a "no path" message that is "N 0" when there does not exist any 
   path between the start and end points of the trip.
