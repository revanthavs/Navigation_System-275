CMPUT 275 WINTER 2021
Assignment #1  Trivial Nagivation System


INCLUDED FILES:-

•client directory
•server directory
•README
•Makefile
•plotter
•link_emulator

MAKEFILE TARGETS:-

The following targets are included in the Makefile:

	•all: runs the server and client targets to generate all the executables.  
	•server: links all object files for the server and builds an executable called server 
         in the same directory as server.cpp.
	•server.o: compiles server.cpp and creates the object file.
	•dijkstra.o: compiles dijkshtra.cpp and creates the object file.
	•digraph.o: compiles digraph.cpp and creates the object file.
	•client: links all object files for the client and builds an executable called client 
		 	 in the same directory as the client.cpp.
	•client.o: compiles the object.
	•clean: removes all executable, objects, and named pipes.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
Compile the server as well as the client program using the makefile targets and then use 
separate terminal win-dows/tabs to run the programs in this order:

./server [server_port]
./link_emulator [server_port] [client_port] [package_drop_rate] [average delay]
./client [client_port] [server IP address]
./plotter

Sample Commands are:
./server 8888
./link_emulator 8888 9999 0.01 50
./client 9999 127.0.0.1
./plotter


Notes and assumptions:

• The plotter and link_emulator programs are built specifically to run on the Virtual Machine 
  and may not run on other platforms.

• The port numbers to be used must be high number ports that can be used for general purposes, 
  like Port 8888.  Do not use port numbers less than 1024, such as port 20, 22, and 80; they 
  are system/reserved ports and can only be used for specific applications, such as SSH, Telnet, 
  FTP. Typically, port numbers in the range of 5000 to 64000 are safe to use.

• If the client or server terminates unexpectedly, the named pipes will not close and will give an
  error 'mkfifo() failed' in the next run.  In that case, delete inpipe and outpipe before running
  the code again.

• Assuming that no two same coordinate will be seleted as start and end coordinates

• Assuming that server need not wait for acknowledgement after sending no path message to
client and waits for new route request from client

• Assuming in case of a package drop complete character array would be lost that is being send from client since it's a small message <64KB

• Assuming that Q quit message form client can be received any time in the program

----------------------------------SERVER-----------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

The server uses a socket to communicate with the client. It receives the route request from
the client, computes the shortest path between the start and end points of the trip, and sends
back to the client the waypoints along the path. The server program uses a timeout of 1 second 
anytime it reads from the client. After the timeout or anytime the server reads an unexpected 
message, it immediately returns to the state where it is waiting for the initial route request 
without sending any further messages. 
In the case where there is no path between two points in the Edmonton road network, the server
simply sends 'N 0' message to the client and returns to the state where it is waiting for a 
request. It does not wait for an acknowledgement in this case.


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the target 'server' to create the executable.
Then in the bash terminal, run the command:
./server [port]

Command Line Arguments:
[port] : the port number of the server

----------------------------------CLIENT-----------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

The client.cpp implements two-way communication with the server with the plotter. It uses pipes
to communicate with the plotter program and sockets to communicate with the server program. 
The client communicates with the server to get the route information (i.e., coordinates of the 
start and end points of a trip) and sends them to the route finding server. It then receives the 
waypoints from the server and sends them to the plotter.

The client uses the timeout of 1 second when waiting for the reply from the server.
After the timeout or anytime the client reads an unexpected message, it should restart the 
request from the beginning (i.e., resend the route request).


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the target 'client' to create the executable.
Then in the bash terminal, run the command:
./client [port] [server IP address]

Command Line Arguments:
[port] : the port number of the client
[server IP address] : The IP address of the server
